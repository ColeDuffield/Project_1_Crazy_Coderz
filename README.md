Project 1: Down To Earth Travel by Crazy Coderz

Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS we have made a travel information site called 'Down To Earth Travel'. This page provides the user information based on the location searched. When a location is entered in the search bar and submitted, the page will present the user with a map of their search and other information. Just below the map, the page provides the user with the name of the location searched, several country currency rates, local hotel options, and temperature. Under the search bar is a list of recently searched locations that when clicked the page will load that locations results. When the page is refreshed the users recent searches should be saved to the page.
